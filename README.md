# Agentic RAG for PDF Processing
This project is an Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that processes PDFs using Gemini as the model, LangChain for agent-based orchestration, and ChromaDB for vector storage. The project is built with GitHub Copilot assistance.

## Features
- Extracts relevant information from PDFs.
- Uses LangChain to create an intelligent agent.
- Stores and retrieves document embeddings with ChromaDB.
- Employs Gemini for natural language understanding and response generation.
## Tech Stack
- Model: Gemini
- Framework: LangChain
- Database: ChromaDB
- Assistant: GitHub Copilot
